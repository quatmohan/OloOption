# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an options backtesting engine specifically designed for QQQ and SPY options trading strategies. The system will load historical option chain data, parse it efficiently, and provide a framework for backtesting various options trading strategies with accurate pricing and risk calculations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a quantitative trader, I want to load and parse the existing 5SecData option chain files for QQQ and SPY, so that I can backtest my options trading strategies against the historical data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL read CSV files from the 5SecData/QQQ and 5SecData/SPY directories with format: timestamp_index, option_type (CE/PE), strike_price, option_price
2. WHEN loading spot data THEN it SHALL parse underlying prices from Spot/*.csv files to determine current spot price at each timestamp
3. WHEN selecting strikes for new positions THEN it SHALL identify 10-15 strikes closest to the current spot price for strategy evaluation
4. WHEN calculating P&L for existing positions THEN it SHALL directly lookup the current option price (LTP) for the specific strike prices in the position

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the system to efficiently structure and index the parsed option chain data, so that I can quickly access option prices by time, strike, and type during backtesting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parsing option data THEN the system SHALL distinguish between CE (call) and PE (put) options
2. WHEN organizing data THEN the system SHALL create time-series structures indexed by timestamp and strike price
3. WHEN accessing data THEN the system SHALL provide fast lookups for option prices at specific time points
4. WHEN calculating Greeks THEN the system SHALL use the underlying spot price and option price data to compute delta, gamma, theta, vega

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a strategy developer, I want to run multiple trading setups simultaneously in the backtesting engine, so that I can evaluate different strategies (like straddle selling) with their own targets and stop losses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the engine starts THEN it SHALL iterate through the 5-second option data chronologically
2. WHEN processing each 5-second interval THEN it SHALL check all active setups for new position opportunities
3. WHEN a setup triggers THEN it SHALL open new positions (e.g., sell straddle with defined strike prices)
4. WHEN positions exist THEN it SHALL calculate current P&L using live option prices and check for target/stop-loss hits
5. WHEN target or stop-loss is hit THEN it SHALL close the position and record the trade result

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a trader, I want comprehensive position management and P&L tracking across all setups, so that I can monitor risk and performance in real-time during backtesting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing positions THEN the system SHALL track P&L for each individual setup separately
2. WHEN calculating total P&L THEN the system SHALL aggregate P&L across all active setups
3. WHEN total daily P&L hits maximum stop-loss THEN the system SHALL immediately close all open positions
4. WHEN generating results THEN the system SHALL provide detailed trade logs with entry/exit times, prices, and P&L for each setup

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an intraday trader, I want the system to handle 0DTE option positions with proper risk management, so that I can backtest intraday strategies without overnight exposure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN trading 0DTE options THEN the system SHALL ensure all positions are closed before market close
2. WHEN calculating position value THEN the system SHALL use real-time option pricing from the 5-second data
3. WHEN managing risk THEN the system SHALL apply intraday position limits and stop-loss rules
4. WHEN positions approach expiration THEN the system SHALL provide warnings about time decay acceleration
